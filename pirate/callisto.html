  <h1> Callisto </h1>
  <p>Schmaiden Schmelvin is a kid with four bunnies named Hoppy McHoppersons, Jumposaurus Rex, Cinnabun, and Paul Bunnyan. The bunnies each have a super snuggly blanket with their favorite delicious snacks (carrots, radishes, bok choy, brussels sprouts) on it ! Every afternoon Schmaidan makes sure to tuck each bunny under their special blankie and make sure they get just the right length nap. Use the clues below to figure out which bunny gets which blankie, and how long to set their alarm clocks.</p>
